While working within a franchisee chain of Mr Simms – a chain of old fashioned sweetshops,  I grew a little frustrated that we were bound by physical boundaries. It is a business that appeals most to tourists as it taps into a bygone era and of quintessential Britishness that is ultimately very marketable. 
<br>There was a preexisting small transactional website business  - operating from the Uxbridge Mr Simms branch with BoxSweet branded packaging (using shop stock). Great product – very visually appealing -  but a platform unbefitting of, the business wasn’t performing at required level.
<br>After a disappointing Christmas (2013) I was brought in in January 2014 and was tasked with its turnaround.   I stripped the business utterly, essentially starting anew.  Identifying a lack of fundamental structure or framework.    
<br>The focus was to be on the website  -www.boxsweet.london [archived] - which I rebuilt on the Shopify platform. Shopify (and all rivals for that matter) I found to be restrictive and incredibly frustrating. 
<br>This paired with the reluctant acceptance that the UK confectionery market is notoriously fierce. The product by its very nature is extremely price resistant. With the average sale at £3.47 (before carriage) – at the bottom end of the market -  margins are extremely tight. The line between profit and loss is by a hairline. The UK marketplace  is utterly saturated. By January 2015 it became apparent we could not make the sums add up. 
<br>A sobering experience. Nonetheless it was an invaluable crash-course in a plethora of areas; perhaps most importantly is that that having total control over ‘front of shop’ implementation is simply vital. This helped me considerably in my decision to  really start  to understand web development and coding and to therefore take a 10-week part-time course on Front-End-Web-Development.
